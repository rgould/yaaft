Lastfm
 - retrieve proper artist name
 - get artist tags
 - get album tags

 - get album tags from user
 - get song tags from user 

Tag format:
   "tag" => weight
   eg: "industrial" => 90
       "ebm" => 70

==Validation==

ReplayGain:
 - check for ReplayGain data in APE tags (should probably upgrade to id3v2)
 - check for ReplayGain data in ID3v2 RVA2 frames
 - check for presence of undo data (which we may or may not want to undo)
 - if absent, perform analysis and write tags
 - note: if ReplayGain as ID3 is required, we must have ID3v2 tags present

ID3v1:
 - if both ID3v1 and v2 are present, raise flag if they differ
 - if only ID3v1 is present, either move or copy to ID3v2
 - check for proper/missing metadata

Bit-rate:
 - bitrate is below a certain threshold
 - average bitrate for VBR

File layout:
 - File conforms to specific layout format
 - eg: %genre/%artist - %year - %album/%track - %title.mp3
 - Multidisc releases have either all tracks in one directory, or one directory per disc.
 - Compilations also conform to specific layout which differs from above
 - File names are safe for other file systems (FAT32, NTFS, contain only strict ASCII character set)

File permissions:
 - correspond to preset properties
 - no execute bit set

ID3v2 Tags:
 - Text strings are encoded properly as UTF-8 (or another encoding)
 
Albums
 - all tracks in the same album have the same album tag
 - most should have the same artist tag
 - if more than X different artist tags, it should probably be in various artists
 - no gaps in the track numbers of the tracks (01, 02, 05, 06, etc.)

Album Art:
 - check that album art exists in directory
 - conforms to valid format (jpg, gif, png)
 - has valid filename (album, cover)
