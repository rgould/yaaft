== Intro ==

I have a massive music collection. It's really obscure music. I've tried organising it using iTunes (that was a mess) and tried using MusicBrainz (a large portion of my collection isn't even in there). Awesomely, it seems that discogs.com knows about most of the music I listen to, followed by last.fm. Let's organise using that data!

Operates on single albums at a time:

> yaaft "/music/Tyske Ludder - Anonymous"

bit-rate: VBR >192KBps - PASS
replay-gain: Adding replay gain tags
verify-metadata:
 artist: Tyske Ludder... OK
 album: Anonymouus... Changed to Anonymous
 year: not present - Changed to 2010
 track 01: Something... OK
 track 02: Something... Changed to Foo
 ...
 track 11: Something... OK

extended-metadata:
 setting genres: Industrial, EBM, German
 cover art not found: Enter URL of cover art:

rename files:
 creating album directory /music/done/Tyske Ludder - 2010 - Anonymous
 renaming files:
   01 - Something.mp3
   02 - Something.mp3

Multiple CD albums should all be passed in on one command line if they are in multiple folders

> yaaft "/music/Rome - Die Æsthetik der Herrschaftsfreiheit - CD1" "/music/Rome - Die Æsthetik der Herrschaftsfreit - C2"

as always, let your shell do the work for you:

> yaaft "/music/Rome - Die Æsthetik der Herrschaftsfreiheit - CD*"

This will organise all the CDs into one directory.

== Organize ==

> organize

- Alarm if bit-rate is too low
- Add ReplayGain tags in ID3
- Verify basic metadata (title, artist, album, year, track number)
- Setup extended metadata (genre, album art)
- Rename file to appropriate structure

== Validation ==

ReplayGain:
 - check for ReplayGain data in APE tags (should probably upgrade to id3v2)
 - check for ReplayGain data in ID3v2 RVA2 frames
 - check for presence of undo data (which we may or may not want to undo)
 - if absent, perform analysis and write tags
 - note: if ReplayGain as ID3 is required, we must have ID3v2 tags present

ID3v1:
 - if both ID3v1 and v2 are present, raise flag if they differ
 - if only ID3v1 is present, either move or copy to ID3v2
 - check for proper/missing metadata

Bit-rate:
 - bitrate is below a certain threshold
 - average bitrate for VBR

File layout:
 - File conforms to specific layout format
 - eg: %genre/%artist - %year - %album/%track - %title.mp3
 - Multidisc releases have either all tracks in one directory, or one directory per disc.
 - Compilations also conform to specific layout which differs from above
 - File names are safe for other file systems (FAT32, NTFS, contain only strict ASCII character set)

File permissions:
 - correspond to preset properties
 - no execute bit set

ID3v2 Tags:
 - Text strings are encoded properly as UTF-8 (or another encoding)
 
Albums
 - all tracks in the same album have the same album tag
 - most should have the same artist tag
 - if more than X different artist tags, it should probably be in various artists
 - no gaps in the track numbers of the tracks (01, 02, 05, 06, etc.)

Album Art:
 - check that album art exists in directory
 - conforms to valid format (jpg, gif, png)
 - has valid filename (album, cover)
